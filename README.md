# Ten Years of Orbit

An interactive web experience exploring fearful-avoidant attachment, the grief of "almost," and learning you can't fix someone else's map.

## About

Between 2016 and 2026, someone orbited my life — returning, disappearing, watching from a distance, but never quite landing. This piece maps that decade through poetry, celestial metaphor, and the physics of bodies that can't quite touch.

Twelve poems drift in space like memories. Ten orbit rings mark ten years. At the center: the constant. In motion: the one who couldn't stay.

## Experience

Visit the live piece: [ten-years-of-orbit](https://lomag-prog.github.io/orbit-editorial (2).html)

Click the floating poems to read them. Click the sun at the center for the dream that lives there. Watch the planet orbit — for a decade, he never stopped circling.

## Technical

Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Physics-based floating elements respond to mouse movement (anti-gravity interaction). Editorial aesthetic inspired by literary journals and the void between wanting and having.

## For anyone who's ever been orbited

If you've loved someone who chose you but couldn't stay, who kept returning but never landing, who made you feel like the problem was your warmth or your distance rather than their map — this is for you.
